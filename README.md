# TFT_ST7735
A fast driver for ST7735 displays that works with Arduino's and Teensy's

This library has been developed over my other library TFT_ILI9163C https://github.com/sumotoy/TFT_ILI9163C
and offer the same speed and same commands. The purpose it's substitute the messy Adafruit_ST7735 with something better.
Like the version 1.0 of TFT_ILI9163C this one doesn't use adafruitGFX but accellerated graphic primitives.
